# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This is my final project for the course Building AI from Reaktor and the University of Helsinki.

## Background

In my last job I nedded to find the most similar pair of lines. This was the best way.

## How is it used?

More kind of solution needed (environment, time, etc.) More kind of needs should be taken into account.

Becouse images will make README look nice! There is a cat:
